Welcome to the [Institute Materials for Electronics and Energy Technology](https://www.i-meet.ww.uni-erlangen.de/) (i-MEET) Github profile!

At i-MEET, we are dedicated to the advancement of materials for electronics and energy technology. Research at i-MEET is focused on fundamental aspects of materials for electronics and for energy technology. Advanced semiconductors with designed optoelectronic properties are investigated for applications in photovoltaics, lighting, energy harvesting, light conversion, medicine technology, plant biology and energy storage.

In this Github profile, you will find repositories for the analysis of solar cells, where we share our codes for characterizing the performance of various types of solar cells.
Our codes are designed to analyze photovoltaic properties such as the current-voltage (IV) characteristics, spectral response, and external quantum efficiency (EQE). 
These repositories can be used as a starting point for researchers and students interested in the analysis of solar cells.

We also provide machine learning packages for labs automation and high-throughtput data analysis. These packages are designed to help researchers and students automate their laboratory tasks by utilizing machine learning algorithms. 
These repositories contain codes for data analysis, prediction, and optimization, and can be used to automate experiments, reduce human errors, and increase the efficiency of laboratory work.

Our team is committed to open science and we believe that sharing our research and codes can help accelerate scientific progress. We welcome contributions from the community and encourage you to use our codes for your research projects.

Thank you for visiting our Github profile, and we hope you find our repositories useful. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://www.i-meet.ww.uni-erlangen.de/contact/).
